# RC-28 Server
Python library for communicating with ICOM RC-28 Controller. 

Can either run locally where the device is connected or over a TCP/IP connection with the server running locally.

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: https://pypi.org/project/hid/ pyhidapi is dependent upon the hidapi library, which must be installed separately.
